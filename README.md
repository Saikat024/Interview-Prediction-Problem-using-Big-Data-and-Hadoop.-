Project Title: Interview Prediction Problem using Big Data and Hadoop. 

         Language: Java. 

         Ecosystem: Hadoop. 

         Software: Oracle VM Virtual Box.

About the Project: The main objective of this project was to predict the attendance of a candidate based on some given dataset. With the help of Map Reduce at first we’ve filtered the data to make it more precise and then with the help of Naive Bayes Theorem we’ve predicted the attendance based on previous observed attendance.
